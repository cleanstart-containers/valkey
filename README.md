## Security Best Practices
Recommended security configurations and practices

- Use specific image tags for production (avoid latest)
- Configure resource limits: memory and CPU constraints
- Enable read-only root filesystem when possible
- Run containers with non-root user (--user 1000:1000)
- Use --security-opt=no-new-privileges flag
- Regularly update container images for security patches
- Implement proper network segmentation
- Monitor container metrics for anomalies

## Kubernetes Security Context
Recommended security context for Kubernetes deployments

```yaml
securityContext:
  runAsNonRoot: true
  runAsUser: 1000
  runAsGroup: 1000
  readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
  allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
  capabilities:
    drop:
      - ALL
```
